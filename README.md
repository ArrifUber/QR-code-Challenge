## My process

I began by setting up the HTML structure using semantic tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`. Then I styled the layout with Flexbox, focusing on alignment and spacing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla CSS (no framework)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the use of semantic HTML and how to keep a component fully responsive and centered using Flexbox.

```html
<article>
  <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  <p>
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
    next level
  </p>
</article>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:

- Explore using CSS Grid for similar card components
- Use a CSS Framework like Tailwind

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) - Flexbox
